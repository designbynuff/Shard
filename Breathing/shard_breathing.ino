//IDEAS
//1. Map proximity sensor input to "breathing rate" (delay between cycles) so it breathes faster as people get closer
//2. Map light intensity to volume level (same as now)
//3. Use audio data to change colour (ideally by generating a unique RGB value)
//4. Re-run 1-3 each cycle so the effect is completely unpredictable/uncontrolled
